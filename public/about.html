<p>I am an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer with a strong passion for technology,
  problem-solving, and continuous learning. My journey into web development began with a desire to combine creativity with functionality,
  and to build digital solutions that can have a real impact. Currently, I am learning modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps,
  with the goal of becoming a versatile developer capable of working across the entire stack.</p>

<p>enjoy turning ideas into interactive and practical applications,
  and I am excited about the possibilities of web developmentâ€”from designing user-friendly interfaces to creating powerful back-end systems.
  For me, coding is more than just writing lines of code; it is about problem-solving, innovation,
  and creating something meaningful that others can use and enjoy.</pI> 

<p>Beyond coding, I bring qualities like discipline, adaptability, and creativity to everything I do.
  I believe in learning by building, and I am always looking for opportunities to challenge myself with new projects and expand my skill set.
  My vision is to grow as a developer who not only writes clean and efficient code but also understands the importance of design, usability,
